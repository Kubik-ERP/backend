# üåü NestJS Starter Kit

This project built with NestJS, TypeScript, and much more.

## Starter Introduction

This application use DDD pattern. Here you can learn a little about DDD pattern, [Visit me](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/domain-driven-design-ddd)

---

## üèÜ Tips

Here's my opinions for write our code more clean and readable. So, you can follow it or ignore it.

1. Always using \_ (underscore) on your private property or method. In typescript, we also can use # (hashtag) to define private property or method Example:

```bash
private readonly _usersService: UsersService;
private _generateToken() {};

// or
#usersService: UsersService;
#generateToken() {};
```

Reason: Some languages like Python also use underscores to denote private or protected members. This convention can make it easier for developers familiar with multiple languages to recognize private members consistently.

Side Effect: -

2. Order naming your variables, function, etc to ascending.

```bash
export const useAuthenticationHook = () => {
  /**
   * @description Reactive data binding
   */
  const [authentication_accessToken, setAuthentication_accessToken] = useState();
  const [authentication_form, setAuthentication_form] = useState();

  const authentication_onCancel = () => {
     // Do something here
  }

  const authentication_onSubmit = () => {
     // Do something here
  }

  return {
    authentication_accessToken,
    authentication_form,
    authentication_onSubmit
  }
```

Reason: One of the most important reasons for creating variables, functions, and so on in ascending sequence is to make things easier while troubleshooting or adding features.

Side Effect: -

3. Create new domain/feature using custom command

```bash
Example: Let's say we want to create a new feature called "products." Instead of manually creating each component, we can leverage a powerful and user-friendly command.

Simply run the following command:
npm run generate:module name-of-feature

For example:
npm run generate:module products

```

What Does This Do?
This command automatically generates the necessary structure for your new feature, including:

- Controllers: Manages incoming requests and returns responses.
- DTOs (Data Transfer Objects): Defines the structure of data for requests and responses.
- Entities: Represents the data models and how they map to the database.
- Interfaces: Defines TypeScript interfaces for strong typing and consistency.
- Services: Contains the core business logic for your feature.

> With this command, you no longer need to manually use the Nest CLI for these tasks‚Äîsaving you time and ensuring consistency across your project.

Why Use This Command?

- Efficiency: Automates the creation of boilerplate code and standard structure, allowing you to focus on business logic.
- Consistency: Ensures that every new feature follows the same structure and conventions, which improves maintainability.
- Convenience: Eliminates repetitive tasks and speeds up the development process.

Side Effects
By using this custom command, the following benefits are achieved:

- Reduced Setup Time: Developers can start working on the actual business logic almost immediately.
- Minimized Errors: The generated code adheres to best practices and reduces the likelihood of human error.
- Enhanced Developer Experience: A streamlined workflow that enhances productivity and satisfaction among developers.

### Conclusion:

Actually, there are plenty other approaches to make our code cleaner and easier to read for humans. However, at this time, I'd want to underline the two points listed above. Because, as previously said, I am using the same code approach in my project.

As a result, I ask any creators who want to participate in this project to keep the previously created code consistent.

## üìñ Notes

When we wish to include a new package or library into this project. I ask that you first conduct some study on the package or library that you intend to utilize.

When it comes to adding a new package or library, there are various factors to consider. Among them are:

1. Is the package or library frequently updated by its creator?
2. Is the package or library popular with other developers?
3. Does the package or library have a lot of issues?
4. Is the package or library small in size?
5. Is the package or library simple to use and has a big impact on our project? etc.

I believe we can add the desired package or library once it has passed the five criteria outlined above. However, if you wish to start a conversation regarding the package or library you want to add, please do so in the project's discussion thread on GitHub.
